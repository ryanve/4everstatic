# 4ever static
Placeholder for slides for my [jamstack talk submission](https://jamstackconf.com) called <b>4ever static</b>

## blurb

The web is our canvas. This talk is for creators. Hybrids. It'll inspire you with [inklusive](https://github.com/s9a/inklusive) examples and give tips for doing creative work via Github. Push the web forward via constraint and bold static design.

## bio

Creator. Namer. Hybrid. Creating on Github [@ryanve](https://github.com/ryanve) [@s9a](https://github.com/s9a) [@subpicture](https://github.com/subpicture)

## sidenote

I just found out about this at 11pm on submission night. I've had the idea to do this talk for a while and think it's a perfect fit for jamstack. I can finetune description and bio if needed. I'm pumped to give this talk. I know the audience. Not so technical. It'll be the most memorable and inspiring one I promise `<3`

## namewise
<b>4ever static</b> feels like the best name. This name ideation got me there.
